### Project Aim: 
Fake online review detection in healthcare sector using sentiment analysis, review attributes and support vector machine learning. Online reviews are considered as a primary source of information for consumers before buying a product or service including healthcare. Online reviews can be fake which are posted either to attract consumers by misleading them or may cause a negative effect on a business by posting wrong information

### Tasks:
1. Retrieve the data
2. Clean the data
3. Perform EDA
4. Perform feature engineering and utilize NLP to derive POS tagging, sentiment calculation and ratios derivation (Noun to noun ratio), average words per sentence and a few others
5. Build the SCM classification model
6. Meausre the model's performance using relevant performance metrics

### Insights:
1. Main finding is that accuracy of model increases by approximately 5% when part-of-speech and sentiment score are used as inputs to the model.
2. Ssignificant difference between the polarity scores of fake and honest reviews can be noticed
